[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/43d71a4fac7f4f9cab86a5d88466e2c0)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/MCT32/VelocityEngine/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade) 

This is a game engine made to roughly follow the development timeline of Quake (I may end up developing it further to the GoldSrc engine and beyond) by iterating though the versions of the [id Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech) engine. This project is simply to learn more about the inner workings of game engines and will likely not be used to make a game. Anyone may use it to make their own game however.
